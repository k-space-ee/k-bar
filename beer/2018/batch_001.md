| 0 | 40 | 4.2 | 2018-06-13 | 0 | Brew Day! Took 4 hours, need to plan ahead to limit to 2 h (including cleaning and sanitizing). This time added 0.25 g of servomycel as the beer from previous batch was still going. Hopefully this will helpyeast to finish the fermentation. Also need to look into water chemistry as tap water has a lot of calcium deposits in it. <details><summary>Adding Servomycel (yeast nutrient, made locally, lol)</summary><p><img src="../../img/0011.jpg" alt="0.25g of Servomycel going into the bucket" title="Last, but not least, ingredient"></p></details> |
| 1 | 12 |  | 2018-06-18 | 5 | Beer has yellow color, small fizz and a lot of small bubbles that refuse to disperse. <details><summary>Most probably an incorrect gravity measurement</summary><p><img src="../../img/0012.jpg" alt="Bubbles pushing hydrometer upwards" title="A lot of small bubbles"></p></details> |
| 2 | 12 | 3.68 | 2018-06-21 | 8 | Beer has a bread-y aftertaste. Bubbles disperse more easily. |
| 3 | 12 | " | 2018-07-05 | 23 | Midsummer holidays postponed bottling. Density has remained the same and beer, and is a not clear and has an amber-yellowish hue. |

| 5 | " | " | 2018-07-19 | 37 | Due to recent summer heat and the fact that hackerspace is technically in the attic, the temperatures have been rather high (>= 25&#8451) an inevitable has happened -- a case of bottles (21 to be exact) perished due to high pressure from the heat. Ironically about the same time when we started looking for a fridge for better temperature control. Removed glass shards and moved the bottles to the food fridge. Opened a bottle to taste, which was nice light cerveza which was a tad sweet. <br><details><summary>Mitigated tragedy</summary><p><img src="../../img/0015.jpg" alt="Shards!

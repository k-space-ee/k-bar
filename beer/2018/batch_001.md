| 0 | 40 | 4.2 | 2018-06-13 | 0 | Brew Day! Took 4 hours, need to plan ahead to limit to 2 h (including cleaning and sanitizing). This time added 0.25 g of servomycel as the beer from previous batch was still going. Hopefully this will helpyeast to finish the fermentation. Also need to look into water chemistry as tap water has a lot of calcium deposits in it. <details><summary>Adding Servomycel (yeast nutrient, made locally, lol)</summary><p><img src="../img/0011.jpg" alt="0.25g of Servomycel going into the bucket" title="Last, but not least, ingredient"></p></details> |
| 1 | 12 |  | 2018-06-18 | 5 | Beer has yellow color, small fizz and a lot of small bubbles that refuse to disperse. <details><summary>Most probably an incorrect gravity measurement</summary><p><img src="../img/0012.jpg" alt="Bubbles pushing hydrometer upwards" title="A lot of small bubbles"></p></details> |
| 2 | 12 | 3.68 | 2018-06-21 | 8 | Beer has a bread-y aftertaste. Bubbles disperse more easily.

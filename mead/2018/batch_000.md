# Brewing mead @ k-space.ee - Batch 000

_2018-06-21_



### Idea (of this brew)
Backstory is that a local urban beekeep had some bee food that supposedly started brewing by itself. To try to conserve the wild yeast then did not add the store bought mead yeast. Hopefully will get going :)

### Ingredients
* 6 mugs of honey
* ~25 l of water, some boiled some not, kept around 27 degrees Celsius
